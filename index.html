    <h1>Non-Responsive Web Design Is for Jerks</h1>
      <p>Responsive web design is the key to making your site accessible to users on all devices. We've all been there -- on our mobile devices, clicking on a link sent by a friend or posted on Facebook, and we get to the site only to find that the content doesn't fit on the mobile page.</p> 
      <p>For retail sites, this can be an especially troubling situation. After all, it's rare that any company makes a unique product. So if I have a choice between your non-responsive site that's difficult to navigate and a responsive site that makes it easy to get exactly where I need to go, which would I choose?
      </p>
      <p>It's already known that a slower page correlates directly with lost revenue, and there are examples out there indicating that a non-responsive site will have the same effect on conversions.
      </p>
      <p>So the bottom line is that if you want to make money off the people who visit your site, responsive web design is what you need in order to make the experience as seamless and efficient as possible for the consumer. 
      <p>If you want to make money off the people who visit your site, responsive web design is what you need in order to make the experience as seamless and efficient as possible for the consumer. And even if it's not a retail site, you want your readers or followers to enjoy visiting the site and not dread every time they have to load your page. Bottom line -- make it look better, and use responsive web design to do it.
